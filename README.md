my nixos home configuration, modularized, managed with home-manager.
*EDIT* current setup still uses home-manager but 'home-manager switch' is now handled with a 'nixos-rebuild switch' rebuild or when system is rebuilt with my custom SYSTEM wrapper (not the bash script residing in this repo, as it's now deprecated.)
